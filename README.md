- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisgonzalez0
- 👀 I’m interested in using data and data science to solve complex problems, especially the problems that I think could make a difference in people's lives. I'm especially interested in using data/data science to help sports teams (basketball and football mostly) identify talent and take advantage of inefficiencies in decision making. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create my very own standalone AWS instance and RDS cofniguration to host my very own data science apps.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything but I'm also very interested in working in the sports industry. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email chrisgonza@gmail.com or by phone at 915-497-2971
